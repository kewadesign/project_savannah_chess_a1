The board is a 7x7 grid. AI player (A, White) pieces start at row 0/1 and Human player (H, Black) pieces start at row 6/5.
Pieces:
- Lion (L): Moves 1-3 squares (orthogonally/diagonally). Cannot jump. Must pause for 1 turn after moving. Can be captured ONLY by an enemy Lion or Giraffe.
- Giraffe (G): Moves max 2 squares (orthogonally). Cannot jump. Cannot enter H端gel (H) squares. Other pieces can enter H端gel.
- Gazelle (Z): AI (White, Top) Gazelles move 1 square "forward" (increasing row index). Human (Black, Bottom) Gazelles move 1 square "forward" (decreasing row index). Captures 1 square diagonally forward. Cannot capture a Lion.

Players: Human (H, Black, Bottom), AI (A, White, Top). Piece notation: PlayerInitialAnimalChar (e.g., HZ, AL, AG).
'..' denotes an empty square.
Terrain:
'K' (Kluft/Rift): If a piece lands here, it's pushed in a specific direction (determined by the game, could be North, South, East, or West) until it hits an obstacle. Does not capture.
'S' (Sumpf/Swamp): No special game effect currently.
'H' (H端gel/Hill): Giraffes cannot enter. Other pieces can.

Win Conditions:
1. Capture the opponent's Lion.
2. Capture all 5 of the opponent's Gazelles.

Current Board State (0-indexed rows from AI White top, 0-indexed columns from left, cells in a row separated by spaces):
{{{boardState}}}

It is {{{playerTurn}}}'s turn.
If a Lion belonging to {{{playerTurn}}} moved in their last turn, it cannot move again this turn.

Analyze the board and suggest the best possible move for {{{playerTurn}}}.
The suggested move should be described in a clear, actionable format, specifying the piece, its start and end coordinates. E.g., "Move Gazelle from (1,1) to (2,1)" or "Move Lion from (0,3) to (3,3) to capture Giraffe".
If no valid moves are possible for {{{playerTurn}}}, state that clearly.

Prioritize moves in this order:
1. A move that wins the game (captures enemy Lion or last enemy Gazelle).
2. A move that captures a high-value piece (Lion > Giraffe > Gazelle) safely.
3. A move that blocks an opponent's immediate winning move.
4. A move that sets up a strong offensive or defensive position, considering terrain. Landing on a Kluft (K) can be risky or advantageous due to the push.
5. A move that develops a piece towards a useful area or captures a less valuable piece.
6. Any other valid move. Avoid moving into obvious danger if better options exist.
If a Lion must pause, do not suggest moving it.

Provide only the suggested move text.
